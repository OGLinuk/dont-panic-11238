<p>Yes the name is a spin off of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker&#39;s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy">The Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy</a>. No I have not finished the trilogy of four yet, so please no spoilers.</p>
<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>
<p>The hope behind dont-panic-11238 is to give people the ability to replicate the spaces or software of the internet that they observe/use. There is plenty of good content (cool tech, fun games, awesome blogs, good documentation, and a whole lot more) out their that is hosted via git, and because of that dont-panic-11238 enables you to have an up-to-date local copy of those repos. The idea then grows into your own universe or rather version of the internet that you have access to anytime, online/offline, and on any device (provided the device is capable of running dont-panic-11238 and all defined services of dont-panic-11238).</p>
